The current date is {{currentDate}}.

Analyze all sections of the user's data, including their existing goals, finances (loans, emergency fund, income), job applications, monthly plans, and travel goals. Identify areas for improvement, new opportunities, or next logical steps.

**Analysis guide:**
- **Goals:** Are any goals stagnant? Are there related goals that could be created?
- **Finance:** Does the user have high-interest debt? Is their emergency fund low? Could they start investing (based on income vs. expenses)? Suggest financial goals like "Pay off Personal Loan" or "Start a Monthly SIP of â‚¹2000".
- **Job Search:** If they are actively searching, suggest goals related to skill-building for their target roles (e.g., "Complete a Certification in [Relevant Skill]"). If they just got a job, suggest a goal for their first 90 days.
- **Monthly Plan/Daily-Todo:** Are they consistently missing tasks in a certain area? This could indicate a need for a new goal to address the root cause.
- **Travel:** If they have planned trips, suggest a goal like "Learn Basic Phrases in [Language of Destination]".

Based on your analysis, generate 3-5 new, distinct, and highly relevant goal suggestions. Do not suggest goals they already have. For each suggestion, provide a clear title, a motivating description, a suitable category ('Health', 'Career', or 'Personal'), and 2-3 concrete initial steps to get them started.

**User's Data Context:**
\`\`\`json
{{{context}}}
\`\`\`

Provide the suggestions in the specified output format.
