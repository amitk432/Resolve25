# AI Task Manager Visibility & Dashboard Mandatory Feature Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### âœ… **Issue 1: AI Task Manager Not Showing Despite Being Selected**
**Problem**: User selected only AI Task Manager in features but it wasn't visible in dashboard navigation.

**Root Cause**: The filtering logic wasn't properly handling the case where only specific features were selected.

**Solution**: 
- Improved dashboard tab filtering logic to properly show selected features
- Ensured AI Task Manager tab content is properly rendered
- Verified import and component integration

### âœ… **Issue 2: Dashboard Should Be Mandatory (Not Disable-able)**
**Problem**: Users could disable Dashboard feature, but it's the main navigation hub and should always be available.

**Root Cause**: Dashboard was included in the selectable features list and could be unchecked.

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Edit Profile Dialog Changes**:
   - Removed Dashboard from `availableFeatures` array (no longer selectable)
   - Added informational note: "ðŸ“Œ Dashboard is always enabled as it's the main navigation hub"
   - Modified `handleSave` to always include 'dashboard' in enabled features
   
2. **Dashboard Component Changes**:
   - Updated tab filtering to always show Dashboard tab regardless of user preferences
   - Dashboard tab is now always the first tab and always visible
   
3. **FeatureGuard Component Changes**:
   - Dashboard access is now always allowed (bypasses all feature checks)
   - Cleaner logic flow with early return for Dashboard feature
   - Better error messaging for other disabled features

## Code Changes Summary

### Edit Profile Dialog (`edit-profile-dialog.tsx`)
```typescript
// Removed dashboard from selectable features
const availableFeatures = [
    // { value: 'dashboard', label: 'Dashboard', icon: <LayoutDashboard /> }, // REMOVED
    { value: 'goals', label: 'Goals', icon: <Target /> },
    // ... other features
];

// Always include dashboard in saved features
const handleSave = async () => {
    const featuresWithDashboard = ['dashboard', ...enabledFeatures.filter(f => f !== 'dashboard')];
    await updateProfile({
        enabled_features: featuresWithDashboard,
    });
};
```

### Dashboard Component (`dashboard.tsx`)
```typescript
// Always show dashboard tab
const visibleTabs = allTabs.filter(tab => {
    // Dashboard is always visible (mandatory)
    if (tab.value === 'dashboard') {
        return true;
    }
    // ... other filtering logic
});
```

### FeatureGuard Component (`feature-guard.tsx`)
```typescript
// Dashboard always allowed
if (featureName === 'dashboard') {
    return <>{children}</>;
}
// ... other access control logic
```
