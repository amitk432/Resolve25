- Background color: Light, desaturated green (#F0FFF0) to provide a clean, calming backdrop that doesn't distract from the content. 
- Accent color: Analogous, brighter green (#32CD32) for key CTAs and progress indicators. Its greater saturation highlights important interactive elements.

- Use simple, clear icons to represent different goal categories (e.g., health, career, personal development). Icons should be easily recognizable and consistent throughout the app.
- Subtle animations, such as a progress bar filling up or a checkmark appearing upon completion, to provide positive feedback and enhance user engagement.
