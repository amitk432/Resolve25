# Resume PDF Generation Fixes - Analysis & Solutions

## Issues Identified from Downloaded Resume vs Expected Output

### 1. Contact Information
**Current Issue**: Shows brackets like "[P]", "[E]", "[L]", "[In]", "[Git]"
**Expected**: Clean format like the preview - phone, email, location, linkedin handle, github handle separated by spaces

**Fix Applied**: Removed ASCII brackets and kept clean contact info

### 2. Skills Section Processing
**Current Issue**: Only shows "Testing Types:" without the skills list
**Expected**: "Testing Types: Manual Testing, Web Automation, Mobile App Automation, API Testing"

**Potential Root Causes**:
- Skills data structure not being passed correctly
- Empty skills data
- Encoding or processing issue in skills iteration

**Debug Logging Added**: Console logs to track skills data processing

### 3. Skills Data Structure Analysis
Based on code analysis:
```typescript
interface ResumeData {
  skills: Record<string, string>; // Object with category keys and skill strings as values
}
```

Expected data format:
```javascript
{
  "Testing Types": "Manual Testing, Web Automation, Mobile App Automation, API Testing"
}
```

### 4. Fixed Code Changes

#### Contact Info Fix:
- Removed ASCII bracket labels
- Clean contact details: phone, email, location, linkedin, github

#### Skills Section Fix:
- Added validation for empty skills
- Improved multi-line handling for long skills
- Better formatting for category names in bold

### 5. Next Steps for Testing
1. Download a resume and check console logs for skills data
2. Verify contact info appears without brackets
3. Confirm skills section shows complete data
4. Match formatting with expected output

### 6. Potential Additional Issues
- Font rendering differences
- Layout spacing consistency
- Section header formatting
- Bullet point styles in work experience
