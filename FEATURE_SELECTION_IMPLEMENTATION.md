# Feature Selection Implementation

## Overview
Added the ability for users to select which features they want to see in their dashboard through the Edit Profile dialog. This allows users to customize their experience by showing only the features they actually use.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Available Features
The system now supports selective visibility for these features:
- Dashboard
- Goals  
- Daily To-Do
- Monthly Plan
- Job Search
- Living Advisor
- Travel Goals
- Car Sale
- Finance Tracker

### 2. Edit Profile Dialog Enhancement
**File:** `src/components/edit-profile-dialog.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added feature selection UI with checkboxes for each available feature
- Each feature displays with its corresponding icon for easy identification
- Added scrollable area for feature list to handle larger screens
- Users can toggle features on/off with individual checkboxes
- Updated dialog size to accommodate the new feature selection section

**New State Management:**
- `enabledFeatures`: Array of selected feature values
- `handleFeatureToggle()`: Function to handle individual feature toggling
- Default behavior: All features enabled for new users

### 3. User Metadata Extension
**File:** `src/hooks/use-auth.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Extended `updateProfile` function to support `enabled_features` array
- Updated TypeScript interfaces to include feature preferences
- Feature preferences are stored in user metadata and persist across sessions

### 4. Dynamic Tab Filtering
**File:** `src/components/dashboard.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `visibleTabs` computation based on user's enabled features
- Updated both mobile navigation (Sheet) and desktop tabs to use filtered tabs
- Added `useEffect` to handle activeTab validation when features change
- Auto-switches to first available tab if current tab becomes unavailable

**Logic:**
- If no preferences are set: Show all features (backward compatibility)
- If preferences exist: Show only selected features
- Smart tab switching: Automatically switches to first available tab if current tab is disabled

## User Experience

### Default Behavior
- New users see all features enabled by default
- Existing users without preferences continue to see all features
- Ensures backward compatibility

### Feature Selection Process
1. User clicks profile menu → Edit Profile
2. Scrolls to "Available Features" section
3. Checks/unchecks desired features
4. Clicks "Save Changes"
5. Dashboard immediately updates to show only selected features

### Smart Navigation
- If user is on a tab that gets disabled, automatically switches to first available tab
- Prevents broken states where user is on an invisible tab
- Maintains smooth user experience during preference changes

## Technical Implementation

### Data Storage
Feature preferences are stored in Supabase user metadata:
```json
{
  "enabled_features": ["dashboard", "goals", "job-search", "finance"]
}
```

### Component Structure
```
EditProfileDialog
├── Profile Information (name, avatar)
└── Feature Selection
    ├── Feature List (scrollable)
    └── Individual Feature Toggle
        ├── Checkbox
        ├── Icon
        └── Label
```

### Tab Filtering Logic
```typescript
const visibleTabs = allTabs.filter(tab => {
  if (!userEnabledFeatures || !Array.isArray(userEnabledFeatures)) {
    return true; // Show all if no preferences
  }
  return userEnabledFeatures.includes(tab.value);
});
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Cleaner Interface**: See only features they actually use
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Less clutter, easier navigation
- **Personalized Experience**: Tailored to individual workflow needs
- **Easy Management**: Simple checkbox interface for changes

### For Developers
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new features to the system
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of feature definition and filtering
- **Flexible**: Can easily extend with more granular permissions in future
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing users unaffected until they choose to customize

## Future Enhancements
- Feature categories/groups for better organization
- Role-based feature access (admin features, etc.)
- Feature usage analytics to suggest optimal feature sets
- Quick preset configurations (e.g., "Student Mode", "Professional Mode")
- Feature descriptions/tooltips in selection interface
